# sessie-0-factorial
Session 0. Factorial exercise.

Write one **recursive** factorial function (use unsigned long int). You obviously know that n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * .. * 1 for n > 0 and that 0! = 1.

Test it with an interactive program that asks the user for an integer. Proceed only if the provided input is positive.

Watch out, at some point the result will not fit in an unsigned long int. Try it out!

After you wrote the recursive function, **start a new branch** called **iterative** and change the recursive function to an **iterative** variant.
